# Correctness backlog

Only unresolved work belongs here. Completed changes and validation history are
in Git; the regression fixtures remain in the test suite.

## Find in Page coverage

Cross-node phrases and revealing closed `details` elements remain unimplemented.
Wrapped fragments of one DOM text node and generated `::before`/`::after` text
are supported.

Generated-text discovery inside skipped subtrees conservatively excludes special
elements which may use a replacement renderer. Resource-dependent fallback needs
a shared decision with element conversion rather than a second implementation
in search. Confirmed reproducer: an `object` with no `data` or `classid`, with
`::before { content:'fallback-token' }`, inside a hidden-until-found ancestor.
Find misses that token before reveal, but finds it after fragment navigation
reveals the ancestor. Images without a usable source and other fallback-capable
elements need the same review. Ordinary generated text is unaffected.

Evidence: `out/render-captures/generated-search-2026-10-03/fallback/steps.json`.

The supported behavior and repeatable checks are in
[hidden-until-found.md](hidden-until-found.md).
