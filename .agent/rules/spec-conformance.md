# Specification Conformance
AI agents must prioritize technical accuracy by adhering to official standards.

## Rules:
1. **Consult Official Specs**: Before considering a fix final or when designing a proposed fix, you **must** look up the official specifications (e.g., W3C CSS specifications, WHATWG standards, or relevant RFCs).
2. **Strict Conformance**: Ensure that your implementation or proposal conforms to these official standards.
3. **Notify on Deviations**: If you find that following the official specification is hard, impossible, or would lead to unexpected issues in the context of this project, you **must** notify the USER and explain the discrepancy before proceeding.
